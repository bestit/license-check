This tool can be used to check the licenses of the used packages.

## Installation

Our package can be installed with composer with the following command:
```bash
composer require best-it/license-check --prefer-dist
```

## Usage

Create a YAML configuration ([license-check.yml](license-check.yml)) like this:
```yaml
allowed-licenses:
  - MIT

allowed-packages:
  composer:
    - /best-it\/license-check/
    - /best-it\/.*/
  npm:
    - /test\/test/
```

The allowed packages must be defined as a regular expression.

Execute the following command to get a report which includes the information that everything is compatible or that
some dependencies are not compatible with your configuration. In case of problems the error code is 1.
```bash
./vendor/bin/license-check 
```
